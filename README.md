# Arkane.Zeroconf
A Zero Configuration Networking library for .NET.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2f9y557cd7k5o760?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cerebrate)

Basically, this is my forked version of Mono.Zeroconf for my .NET projects, which exists simply because I needed a version with various fixes that have been submitted in pull requests over the last few years, and which the release version of that package doesn't have. It's Windows-only because that's the platform I use, and the one I'm competent to support. API, etc., are identical to that of Mono.Zeroconf except for the different namespace.

To run this, Apple's Bonjour must be installed first.

Bonjour for Windows can be downloaded here:
